I changed the button for canine, feline, and otter.
When you click them, now they would show a custom dialog instead of a window alert.
Each button outputs a different dialog.

I also updated the vote button.
 When you click it, now you would make voting selection in a custom dialog. The website also outputs what you select.

 I included Google Analytics in my website because I would like to track what is the highest voted animal.
